#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'
# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep
# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/tmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep
# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/storage/*
!/storage/.keep
.byebug_history
